# Engine Feature List

### Game Engine

#### Game Types
* Clicker:
  * Tap as fast as you can to generate in-game currency. While this is used in many idle games, it lacks long-term appeal and should be used in conjunction with other mechanics.
* Simulation:
  * Idle games can have a less hands-on approach for users by simulating tasks. For example, instead of using the clicker mechanic, players focus on managing and strategizing.
* Arcade:
  * This is traditional arcade-style gameplay that enables the user to achieve an objective relevant to their targets.
* Merge:
  * Users are able to succeed by dragging and dropping items. This can work particularly well for themes that involve building progression.

#### Game Features
* Main Game/Event Game
  * Allow multiple "Worlds" so you can run timed events for bonus content/rewards

#### Actor Types
* Primary Currency: 
  * This is the main number that is being incremented, generally the goal of the game. Usually it’s some form of money.
* Generator: 
  * The items in the game that produce primary currency. The rate of production, or income, is measured as currency per second.
* Primary Exchange Currency: 
  * In some cases generators produce a different currency that is exchanged for primary currency. For example, in Clicker Heroes the generators produce DPS, which is then converted into gold by killing monsters. That layer of separation can give you a bit more control over the growth of the primary currency in the game, since you can modify the “exchange rate” over time.
* Multiplier: 
  * Any of a variety of upgrades that multiplies your generator power. These can be explicit upgrades, based on number of generators owned, etc. Their purpose is to (temporarily) get production closer to, or ahead of, costs.
* Prestige: 
  * A reset of most elements of the game (especially generators and multipliers), but gaining currency (prestige currency) and/or persistent multipliers to accelerate the next time through. Similar to a “New Game+”.
